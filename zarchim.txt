	each bit 0 || 1
	bit operations available in c are & | ~ ^ 
	~0x41 -> ~0xBE
		~
	Logical Operators
		view 0 as false
		anything nonzero is true
		always return 0 or 1
		early termination

	Shift operations 
		left shift x << y: 
			shift bit-vector x left y positions
				Throw away extra bits on left
			Fill with 0's on right
		right shift x >> y:
			shift bit-vector x right y positions
				throw away extra bits on right
			Logical shift
				fill with 0's on right
			Arithmetic shift:
				replicate most significant bit on left

	signed vs unsigned in C
	
	
	|Summary
	|casting signed <-> unsigned : basic rules
	|	bit pattern is maintained
	|	but reinterpreted
	|	can have unexpected effects, adding or sub 2^w
	|	int is cast to unsigned !!!
	
	
	Sing extension
	
	Task: 
		given w-bit signed integer x
		convert it to w+k bit integer with same value
	Rule:
		make k copies of sign bit
		X' = xw-1 => k times  + w
		
		signed too = dec +- 16 8 hurtelee uuruuruu baina
